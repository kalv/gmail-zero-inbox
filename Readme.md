# Gmail Zero Inbox

Chrome extension to show a photo of the day with a caption every day
when you clear out your inbox.

## installation
Manually for now. So if you are a chrome developer you will know how to
load an unpacked extension. Simply clone this repo and then install the
extension from `chrome://extensions`.

Then get your inbox to zero to see the image.
